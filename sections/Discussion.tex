todo: better formulation
\begin{itemize}
	\item TJT looks a little sketchy as it is not really available to users and not really talked about apart from the developers
	\item JPaX is not available, comparison here is one for legacy purposes, in case someone still uses it and wonders if they should switch. 
	\item CorC is well suited for smaller units of organisation but might be a little overwhelmed for larger projects due to the graphical nature. 
	\item JML should always be used, because it provides towards documentation and structured specification. 
\end{itemize}
