The conference journal \citep{10.1007/978-3-030-17502-3_9} features a large collection of approaches to software checking. These include a discussion of several software checking methodologies for the programming languages c and java. It provides a deep analysis of entries for a contest of software verification tools.
The next installment of this conference \citep{10.1007/978-3-030-45237-7_21} also features new approaches to software checking, and provides an analysis of runtime, energy consumption and the accuracy of the tools. 
D'Silva, Kronening and Weissenbacher\citep{survey-sv} give an overview of software verification. A fundamental overview over techniques used in verifiers, such as static analysis or abstract interpretation is given.
