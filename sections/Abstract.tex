A crucial part of writing code is the creation of accompanying tests to ensure
	 its correctness. A survey through the several tools and approaches for testing
	 for correctness in Java programs is taken in this paper. These include the
	 Java Modeling Language, the KeY prover, Java PathFinder/PathExplorer,
	 and CorC. These formal methods monitor the execution of Java code to discover
	 bugs. In order to achieve a qualitative comparison, these approaches are applied
	 to a running example
