To conclude on this survey, the use-case for each tool varies, hence no definitive answer can be given. 

The tool choosen by the user should depend on the development environment.
For smaller projects, CorC is a justified choice, as it allows the user to write correct code without external programs, due to CorC effectively being an IDE. 
For other, larger projects tools like KeY or JPF should be concerned. These provide mechanisms for checking larger projects, and finding different classes of errors. Which of these is used depends on factors like user preference or technical details which vary from project to project.
